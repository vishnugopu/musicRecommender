## Observation

<b>Sample 1 :</b>

we are recommending 10 songs based on `I Was Appointed`. Corresponding recommendation are printed in the table above. 1st garph displays cosine similarity between recommended songs. Additionally we are plotting feature vs songs on some of the important features that is being used for recommendation.

Our model is returning songs with high cosine similarity, hence a strong recommendation of similar songs.


<b>Sample 2 :</b>

We used a hindi song (`Nachangeh Saari Raath (Desi-Tronix Mix)`)for which the model successfully recommended 10 songs, however they are not very strong recommendation in terms of cosine similarity(quite low). 


<b>Sample 3 :</b>

Here when we passed a large no of songs to be recommended, our model is returning that no of songs.



An advantage of our model is that it allows individual new Songs (not in MPD) to have tracks easily recommended, without the need for extensive computation to iterate and determine its similarity to other existing playlists in MPD. Unfortunately, not computing its similarity with other playlists also means that, latent relationships outside of musicality are ignored. The existing content-based filtering recommender will not be able to identify suitable songs for playlists which are not based on musical features, for example playlists containing female artists or sexual lyrics only.

Since our model is content based, there is certain drawbacks to that. The content-based recommendation engine will only recommend songs related to the genre and other features of songs and may never recommend anything in other categories like songs from a different genre which might be similar. This problem can be solved using another variant of recommendation algorithm known as Collaborative Filtering.
