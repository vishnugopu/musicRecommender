    "Today&apos;s world, most of the users listen to music online using several competing media services  like spotify, pandora, youtube, etc.. There is no dearth in choice of songs. However, listening to the same song repeatedly will create a stale experience. Acknowledging this fact, companies have been spending a lot of resources to enhancing users listening experience.  Users can extend their playlists, with recommended songs that they most likely matches their unique musical taste, introducing an element of novelty and excitement. This can increase user engagement and encourage continued subscription."
