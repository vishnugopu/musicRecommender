    "## Content-based Filtering\n",
    "Content-based filtering collects information describing the item content and recommend items that are similar to items the user likes. The items are usually represented by n-dimensional feature vectors and the features they contain can be collected automatically, e.g., by extracting features from the audio signal, or in our case we used Spotify API to collect audio features. \n",
    "\n",
    "Content-based recommendation relies heavily on audio content analysis and thus content-based music recommenders exploit traditional music information techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the music domain, content-based filtering ranks songs based on how similar they are to a seed song according to some similarity measure, which focuses on an objective distance between items and does not include any subjective factors. This makes it possible to recommend new items that do not have any user ratings associated with them.\n",
    "\n",
    "There exists a wide variety of approaches for measuring the similarity between songs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Some disadvantages** of Content-based filtering are:\n",
    "- Cold start problem- Content-based recommender system needs time to adapt to new user's preferences. However, the cold start problem does not exist for new items.\n",
    "- Gray sheep- Content-based recommendation relies heavily on what kind of items are in the collection, and the collection may be biased towards a specific user tastes. Thus, it is possible that users with atypical tastes will not receive relevant recommendations.\n",
    "- Novelty- Users can receive recommendations that are too similar when the similarity function is accurate. Content-based recommender systems should promote eclecticness of items by using other factors.\n",
    "- Feature limitation- Content-based recommender system are limited by the features that can be extracted from the content. In other words, the recommender system is limited by the descriptive data that is available.\n",
    "- Modeling user preferences- Content similarity cannot fully capture the user&apos;s preferences, which results in a semantic gap between the user&apos;s perception of music and the music representation of the system. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Approach**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Here our model will measure similarity bectween feature vectors by using cosine similarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cosine similarity** is a measure of similarity between two non-zero vectors of an inner product space that measures the cosine of the angle between them. The cosine of 0 degree is 1, and it is less than 1 for any angle in the interval (0,pi]. It is thus a judgment of orientation and not magnitude: two vectors with the same orientation have a cosine similarity of 1, two vectors oriented at 90 degree relative to each other have a similarity of 0, and two vectors diametrically opposed have a similarity of -1, independent of their magnitude. The cosine similarity is particularly used in positive space, where the outcome is neatly bounded in [0,1]. In other words, vectors are maximally \"similar\" if they&apos;re parallel and maximally \"dissimilar\" if they're orthogonal.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img style=\"float:left;\" src=\"images/cosine distance.png\"> \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "One advantage of cosine similarity is its low-complexity, especially for sparse vectors: only the non-zero dimensions need to be considered."

    "## Model Overview\n",
    "Our model take a new playlist or song as an input and extracts the features from spotify(via spotipy api) for each track and  provide a song for song recommendation using content based filtering. Based on the input song name, we are retrieving the basic track features such as `track_name`, `track_uri` etc. from the `Million Playlist Dataset` and additional features such as `Valence`, `Tempo`, `Loudness` etc.,. Our model tries to find the song's genre and look for matching genres(in our case, we are starting with 4 genres) to search for the similar songs. If the song is from a niche artist, we are reducing the matching criteria and again search for the similar songs until we find maximum number of recommended songs requested.\n",
